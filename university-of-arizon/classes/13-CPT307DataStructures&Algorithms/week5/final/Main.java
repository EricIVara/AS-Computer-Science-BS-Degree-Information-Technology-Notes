/**
 * For this assignment, you will take on the role of a member of an IT department. Your chief technology officer (CTO)
 * has tasked your department with the replacement of IT equipment. Your manager does not want to buy a piece of
 * equipment based on the brand name alone. Rather, your manager wants to know the return on investment for each piece
 * in order to make a sound purchasing decision.
 *
 * - Your task is to write a Java program that will be used to calculate ROI on three different pieces of equipment
 * - sort it from best to least ROI
 * - The program must prompt the user to enter the brand name of the equipment, the gain, and the cost for each piece
 *   of equipment
 *
 * In this coding assignment, you will express searching and sorting algorithms to return the ROI best to least for
 * each piece of equipment. You must apply algorithmic design techniques in developing your program so that you can
 * ensure the user will receive a correctly sorted list. Utilize a LinkedList class to create the list. Include
 * comments for each section of the program. You may select variable names as long as proper Java syntax is used.
