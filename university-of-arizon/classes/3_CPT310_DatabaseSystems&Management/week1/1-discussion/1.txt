Discuss the difference between a Relational and Non-Relational Database in terms of:
 
- the simplicity of design
Relational databases use tables to store data, while non-relational databases use a hierarchical structure. This makes relational databases easier to use and understand, while non-relational databases are better suited for managing complex data.

Relational databases work with structured data, while NoSQL storage can deal with both structured and unstructured data (so basically, all types of Big Data).
SQL databases have predefined schemas and NoSQL data storage has dynamic schemas that allow them to deal with unstructured data.
Relational databases are table-oriented, and NoSQL databases are document-oriented. The relationship-based model of relational databases supports a high level of accuracy and data integrity. If you choose to use a non-relational database, there is a risk of data duplication. Non-relational databases are highly scalable, flexible, and performative. At the same time, maintaining relational databases may become a problem over time.
