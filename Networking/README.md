## Introduction
The internet and its’s computer networks were built to withstand high amounts of user access information or products from individuals all over the world almost instantaneously, but great things always come with a price. Small size companies sometimes don’t realize potential threats, viruses, or added/stolen folders before it’s too late or when the organization begins experience slow network communication, failed applications, and lots of errors from cyber criminals. There are many reasons why a network can fail, or slow, when attempting to send a message or a response back to the client from a server request, and they all involve manual maintenance on the network.


The various types of network layers offer extremely important communication resource services that enable a clear straightforward standardized path for data flow amongst multiple different networks around the world. Data travels through the internet while following specific organizational standards called the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), for proper computer-to-computer communication between different organizations to provide a strict process for all computers to follow when communicating.


## Basics of Networking
### Computer Network Communication How Networks Begin to Fail
Everything changed when the internet was introduced along with its connecting computer networks. The  Internet as well as its computing networks were created to transmit large amounts of information very affectively and efferently from anywhere, and to provide individuals with widespread company access to applications, products, and other data from across the world. However, because this information is transmitting everywhere, cybercriminals may find an easy way of stealing computer contents, files or adding files containing viruses or malware.  Probably one of the most important aspects in managing threats is to understand how exactly communication is being performed and how it’s managed once its' received.


### Network Layers
There are several methods to describe how communication networks start their online journey. Each network can employ a different set of network hardware and software to fulfill these services, but all networks offer a variety of ways to convey messages to specific requestors. To effectively convey a message, all of these pieces of hardware and software must cooperate within different network layers to accomplish an almost instantaneous communication between all users.

### Network Management
Many people think network security is primarily a technical issue, and occasionally it may be. More security hazards, however, might be created by improper network management than by using outdated software and hardware. The majority of the time, antivirus software firms are unable to keep up with the volume of focused assaults from hackers. These dangers include phishing attacks which are fake emails that appear legitimate, and ransomware that impersonates beneficial programs to lock your computer and demand payment. Both people management and technology management are important aspects of network administration. Service communication.


### Secure Storage
The need for safe storage, server space, and methods of data transport will increase as more users seek access to more network services and greater network capacity. New methods of securely storing information will be introduced as we figure out effective ways to store all the data we produce. For effective security measures and the rising need for storage, businesses now have thousands of servers that cost hundreds of dollars apiece. Through magical data-disappearing technologies like cloud computing, businesses today have introduced new techniques to reduce security and storage expenses. What's crucial is that cloud providers are turning more toward the security precautions that the government mandates for safe network service communication.


## TCP/IP Transmission from Applications Through Network and Transport Layers
### Introduction
If adequate transportation and transmission protocols and processes are not implemented, transmitting messages back and forth across a network might run into several difficulties. Although there are many different ways to send messages, in order for users to communicate with one another, a communication network is required. An HTTP response must have a body, a set of headers, and a status in order to satisfy a user's request for data. The modifications in how jpgs, gifs, and images from the web are sent to the receiver also result in a smaller file size. But there is no deterioration in quality. The messages' sizes will change as they are sent.\


### Types of Messages That Can Be Sent
Communication across a network from host-to-host can be done in, many and new ways, including Email, Paging, Short message service, enhanced message service, Multimedia messages service, Instant message, HDML notifications, and application-to-application messaging. Message transmission is done by the transport layer, which connects these messages from the application layer with the network. The application layer sends messages out to the data link layer, which strips them for transmission between routers. The message is then prepared to proceed to the next phase once the Ethernet frame has been stripped and given a new location.


### Message Transmission Through the Network
A specific standardized protocol is needed for data to effectively communicate from one location to the next so that two or more users can transmit data from one another. Users can connect and send data using this protocol in a quick and structured fashion. Models for computer networks, also referred to as computer network models, are used to construct this path for all messages across the internet to follow. The establishment of a connection between the sender and receiver, as well as the efficient transmission of data, are both handled by these combined computer network models. The entire data communication process is based on two computer network models, namely the OSI Model and the TCP/IP Model.
   
The application layer acts as an interface for the program and the user to exchange data. Characters are translated from the host system's native format to the receiving system's format by the presentation layer. The session layer makes it possible to keep running sessions while browsing. In the OSI model, the transport layer, which is the fourth layer, is responsible for reliability, flow control, congestion control, multiplexing, and demultiplexing. Next, is the network layer, which makes it possible for various functions including address assignment, routing, and fragmentation. The Data Link Layer's primary duties are Flow Control, Error Control, Access Control, Framing, and the reading of physical addresses. The electrical, mechanical, functional, and procedural aspects of physical hardware constructed within the physical layer.


### Transmission from the Web Server
The HTTP packet that a web server sends back in response to a client request is often represented as an HTTP response object. A body, a set of headers, and a status are all elements of an HTTP response required by a user’s request for data. The process in reading and validating a full response object, including the status, headers, and content, is an important process to authenticate the HTTP response status properly. As a result, checking each piece of the HTTP response independently is important in double checking the server sends a correct response without any unexpected status code errors. The size of the file is also reduced as a result of the changes in how the web's photos, photographs, gifs, and jpgs are transmitted to the recipient. However, there is no quality loss. The size of the messages will fluctuate as they are being sent.
