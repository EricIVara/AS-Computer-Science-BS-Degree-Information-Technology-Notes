## Introduction
Software engineering is a complex and vast field, with many different concepts and best practices to understand. As I progress through my degree program, I wanted to create a centralized location to track my understanding of each chapter, and to keep my notes organized and accessible. This repository contains my notes on various topics related to software engineering, including:

- Software development methodologies
- Object-oriented programming
- Database management
- Web development
- And more!

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/vara78/BS-Degree-Information-Technology-Notes.git

Once you have the repository on your local machine, you can navigate to each chapter's folder to view my notes and progress. You can also add your own notes, make corrections, or suggest improvements by following the guidelines in the Contributing section.

## Projects
In addition to my notes, I also use this repository to track my progress on various software engineering projects. Each project has its own folder in the repository, and contains all the necessary files and documentation for the project. Some of the projects I'm currently working on include:

- A web-based chat application
- An inventory management system
- A task manager app

## Notes
My notes are organized by chapter, with each chapter having its own folder in the repository. Within each chapter's folder, you'll find a README.md file with a summary of the chapter, as well as any notes I've taken on the chapter's topics. I try to keep my notes concise and organized, with clear headings and bullet points to make them easy to read.

## Ideas
The "Ideas" section of this repository is where I keep track of any new ideas or concepts that I come across in my studies. These ideas might be related to a specific project, or they might be more general concepts related to software engineering as a whole. By keeping track of these ideas, I can come back to them later and explore them further.

## Contributing
